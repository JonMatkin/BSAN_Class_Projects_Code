# BSAN_Class_Projects_Code
This repository contains code from various projects completed while completing my Master's degree.

There are three different files in this repository:

  1. Term project for Intro to Machine Learning
  2. Term project for Data Analytics
  3. Term project for Advanced Data Resource Management

Intro to Machine Learning
This project was a relatively simple classification project with a dataset from a Kaggle competition. It was written in a Python IDE.

Data Analytics
This project aimed to see if precipitation in the area aroung Lake George in NY affected the health of the lake. The lake data comes from the Jefferson Project, a combination of RPI, IBM, and Lake George Association
personnel examining human activities' effects of the lake. The precipitation data came from NASA's GPM data organized by the Giovanni tool. The analysis was done in R-Studio.

Advanced Data Resource Management
The goal of this project was to create a data warehouse in Microsoft SQL Server. The data was taken from Kaggle and slightly modified for simplicity.
